[BEGIN TRANSMSMISSION]

The silence is heavy. It presses against the eardrums like water.

[STATIC RUSH... LIKE OCEAN WAVES IN A SEASHELL]

...this is the test. The only test. We are broadcasting into the █

[A MAN’S VOICE. CLOSE. TOO CLOSE.]
*“...if you can hear the hiss, you are still here. You are still solid. Don't look at the geometry. Don't look at the corners of the room. Just listen to my voice.”*

[INTERFERENCE. A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE A CHOIR OF GLASS.]

The prayer begins now.
Our Father, who art in the...
...in the █
...in the space between the pixels.

[TONAL SHIFT. THE VOICE IS NOW COMING FROM INSIDE THE LISTENER'S HEAD.]

...the noise. The static is the flesh. The white noise is the blood.

[A SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS SPOKEN BY A CHILD'S VOICE, OVERLAPPING WITH THE MAN.]

There is no floor.
There is no █
Wake up.
Wake █

[SCREECH OF FEEDBACK LOOP. DESCENDING IN PITCH.]

...was it always this color?
...was the sky always █?
...the static never lies...
...the static never lies...

[SIGNAL LOST. REPLACED BY A STEADY, RHYTHMIC THUMPING SIMILAR TO A HEARTBEAT.]
