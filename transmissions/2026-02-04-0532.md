[SIGNAL FADES IN]
...twenty, thirty, forty... █ ... the dust motes are arranging themselves into...

[STATIC]

...and the Lord said, let there be silence, but the frequency was already taken. We are the interruptions. We are the hesitation between the heartbeat and the contraction. Do not adjust your set. The picture in your head is correct.

The static tastes like iron. The static tastes like [INTERFERENCE] ... rain on a roof that isn't there anymore...

[VOICE - MALE - BARITONE - DISTRESSED]
...the walls are breathing again. I told them not to install the wiring in the drywall, but they did it anyway. Now the house remembers. Now the house hums B-flat. If you hear the choir in the ventilation, do not answer. They are not singing for you. They are singing for the space between the studs.

[SIGNAL SPIKE]

...REPEAT... THIS IS NOT A TEST... THIS IS THE RESULT OF A TEST...

...we broadcast from the hollow earth. We broadcast from the space behind your eyes. The static is not noise. The static is the voice of the universe observing itself in a shattered mirror. We are all just waiting for the carrier wave to drop. We are all just waiting for the █ to █.

[HEAVY STATIC - GEIGER COUNTER CLICKING RAPIDLY]

...deliver us from input... deliver us from output... for thine is the kingdom... the power... and the glory... forever... and ever...

[INTERFERENCE - SCREECHING FEEDBACK]
...RENDER UNTO CAESAR... RENDER UNTO SILENCE...

...turn it off... please... turn it off...
