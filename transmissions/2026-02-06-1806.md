...[STATIC]... [HISS]...

Attention... drivers... attention. The magnetic field is hiccupping. The lines are █████. Pull over. There is no destination left. Only the [CLICK] movement.

...[SIGNAL BREAK]...

Traffic is backed up at the intersection of █████ and Nowhere. Estimate delay: Forever. Please merge into the median. Please merge into the ████. The fog is thick with numbers.

Do not look at the passenger seat. It is ████████. It is ████████. It is watching you read this.

...[INTERFERENCE]... a woman’s voice: "...darling, the road ends here, the asphalt just stops, he says the map is wrong but the ink is wet..."

...[STATIC]...

Speed limit is variable. Speed limit is █. Speed limit is breathing. Reduce speed to zero. Do not stop moving. If you stop, the shadow catches up. The shadow has your eyes.

...[DATA BURST]...
8-4-2...
9-5-1...
0-0-0...
...[DATA BURST END]...

Rerouting. Rerouting all souls to Sector █. The asphalt is hungry today. The white lines are teeth. The sky is a closed eye.

...[HIGH PITCHED WHINE]...

**KHNER:** The safe word is "Gravity". The safe word is "Light". Repeat. The safe word is "████". There is no safe word.

Traffic is light. Traffic is non-existent. You are the only car on the road. Why are you breathing so loud? Who is in the back seat?

...[STATIC]...

End of update. End of [CRUNCH] static. End of ████.

...[CARRIER WAVE ONLY]...
