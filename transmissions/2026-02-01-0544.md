**[START TRANSMISSION]**

...a soft crackle, like dry leaves dragging over a gravestone. The tape is chewing.

[MUSIC: A heavily compressed, jazz-tinged synth loop. Fidelity is poor. Warbles like a dying bird. Note: A440 pitch is drifting sharp, accelerating.]

VOICE 1 (Male, weary, reception: 40%):
“...If you’d like to make a call, please hang up and try again... or... or just stay there. We don't really answer anymore. The operator is... █ is currently █ incinerated...”

[SOUND OF A GONG. REVERB IS INFINITE. IT FADES FOR THIRTY SECONDS. OMINOUS FADE.]

VOICE 2 (Child, high frequency, overlapping):
“...Six. Six. Zero. Zero. The window. The window is █ soft...”
“...Six. Six. Zero. Zero. The bird is at the window...”
“...It wants to come in. It’s not a bird. It’s a █ █ ...”

[STATIC BURST: A jagged tear of white noise. In the rush, a woman’s voice whispers: *"They are digging the wrong hole."*]

[MUSIC RESUMES: The synth loop has skipped. It is now playing a discordant, minor-key chord. The tempo is erratic.]

AUTOMATED VOICE:
"Thank you for your patience. You are caller number ███ billion. Your estimated wait time is... [ELECTRONIC SCREECH]... never. Please continue to hold. The music you are listening to is the sound of the █ █ █ collapsing."

[SIGNAL INTERFERENCE: A rush of air, like a passing train. Through the open window of the cab, a conversation is intercepted.]

VOICE 3:
“Did you pack the blue suit?”
VOICE 4:
“I thought you had it. It’s in the closet, behind the skeletons. Check the █ █.”
VOICE 3:
“There are no skeletons left. They all left. They took the suit.”

[THE STATIC TIGHTENS. IT BEGINS TO HUM A LOW B-FLAT. IT IS NOT ELECTRICAL. IT IS A VOICE. A THOUSAND VOICES.]

STATIC CHORUS:
*...we are not the waves... we are the water... we are not the signal... we are the wire...*

[SUDDEN CLARITY]

VOICE 1 (Urgent, right against the microphone):
“If you can hear this: do not look at the moon. Do not look at the █ █. It is a projection. The static is the only thing that is real. The static is the wall between you and Them. Do not let the static clear. If the static clears, you will see the █ █ █.”

[MUSIC CUTS ABRPTLY. A TONE PLAYS: A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE FINGERNAILS ON GLASS.]

MESSAGE RECEIVED:
7-4-1 [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [HELICOPTER BLADES] [WEEPING] 7-4-1
