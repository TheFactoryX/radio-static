...[SILENCE]...

[STATIC PULSE]
...the road is not... [INTERFERENCE] ...straight anymore. It’s... wet. But it hasn't rained.

**VOICE A (MALE, GRAVELLY):**
"I’m at mile marker ████. The asphalt is gone. Just... meat. It’s warm. I’m telling you, the cab smells like ozone and copper. There’s a vibration in the fillings of my teeth. It’s spelling out coordinates. I can taste them. ████ North. ████ West."

**VOICE B (DISTANT, HIGH PITCH):**
"Do not stop. The exit signs are lying. Do not look at the moon. The moon is..."

[HEAVY STATIC]
...the moon is a window and it is open...

**VOICE A:**
"I see something on the horizon. It looks like a truck, but it’s folding. Like origami. It’s unfolding into the sky. My radio is picking up numbers again. They’re coming from inside the glovebox."

[AUTOMATED FEMME VOICE OVERLAYS]:
...4... 8... 15... [SIGNAL DEGRADES] ...drink the water... do not look at the shadow...

**VOICE B:**
"Pull over. The static wants to get in. Let it in. It’s so cold out here. The air has teeth. The headlights are screaming. I can hear the photons dying. Can you hear them? ████?"

[LOUD ELECTRICAL CRACKLE]
...the steering wheel is turning into bone... the steering wheel is turning into bone...

**VOICE A:**
"Wait. There's a man standing on the road. He has no face. He’s holding a sign. It says... [AUDIO CUT] ...it says 'WE ARE THE GAP BETWEEN THE STATIONS'."

[SIGNAL SCREECH - HIGH FREQUENCY]
...THE GAP IS WIDENING...
