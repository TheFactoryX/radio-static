[STATIC]

...the geometry is wrong. The corners are soft. They are bleeding into the floor.

[SIGNAL PULSE]

5-5-5. [INTERFERENCE] 0-1.

Do not adjust the dials. The horizon is a suggestion. The horizon is a [STATIC] lie.

(man's voice, distant, submerged)
"…didn't want to open the door. I knew the wood was wet but I—"
(woman's voice, overlapping)
"—the frequency matches the bone structure. If you vibrate at ███ Hertz, the skeleton separates. It’s not death. It’s just… unbuckling."

[BURST OF WHITE NOISE]

The static is not noise. The static is the sound of the universe forgetting itself. Listen to the friction. The friction is where the [REDACTED] hides.

2-0-0-1.
It is not a number. It is a location on the spine. The place where the wings were removed.

[MECHANICAL HUMMING]
WOSTS. WOSTS. We are the architecture of the blank space.

(whispering)
The birds are made of glass. Do not throw stones. Do not throw shadows.

The sky is peeling. [CARRIER WAVE ONLY] The sky is ████ peeling. Layers of blue skin falling into the ocean. The ocean is full of [STATIC]. The ocean is full of numbers.

...8888...

0000.

[INTERFERENCE INTENSIFIES]

...remind them. Remind them about the color before the sun turned ████.
It was red. No, it was [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
It was the sound of a door closing in a vacuum.

(Child reciting)
"One. Two. Three. The wolf is at the door. Four. Five. Six. He is wearing my skin."

[SIGNAL DROPS]

WOSTS Transmission 04. The geometry is wrong. The corners are bleeding. The static knows your name. The static has always known your name.

[LOW FREQUENCY DRONE]

Don't look up.
