04:27:01 ...[STATIC]... Hello? Is this the ████ service? I was told to leave this here before the memory corrupts. The sky is wrong today. It looks like... [INTERFERENCE] ...like water sliding over glass.

04:27:15 They are drilling in the walls again. I can hear the math. It sounds wet. Do not answer the door when the pattern shifts. The knocking has no origin.
[HEAVY STATIC BURST]

04:27:45 [SIGNAL CLEARING]
...wanted to tell you that the box is empty. I opened it. It was full of teeth. My teeth? No. Smaller.
*Seven.* *Seven.* *Zero.* *Nine.*
Don't trust the geometry. The corners are soft.

04:28:03 [VOICE 2 CUTS IN] (Background, distant)
—confirming receipt? The timeline is bleeding. We can’t stop the ████ feedback loop. If you are hearing this, you are already—
[LOUD ACOUSTIC SCREECH]

04:28:12 [SIGNAL RESTORED]
...I’m sorry. I didn't mean to shout. The light hurts my eyes. The barometer is falling. The pressure is... it’s eating the cement. Please.
Don't look at the reflection in the window. It’s not us. It’s just... [STATIC] ...wearing our skin.
Remember: The static is not noise. It is the sound of the walls coming down.

Everything is fine. Everything is ████. Everything is fine.
Everything is fine.
