[BEGIN TRANSMSMISSION]

[STATIC... like insects crawling inside the ear canal]

[SIGNAL PITCHES LOW, UNDULATING LIKE A SICK STOMACH]

...breaker one-nine... breaker one-nine... is there anybody out there on the old slab? The black tar is breathing tonight... I see it... I see it bubbling...

[LOUD CRACK OF STATIC]

This is... ████... I’m at Mile Marker ████... the map says there’s a straightaway here but the road just... it just keeps folding back on itself. I’ve passed the same billboard three times. The little girl on the billboard... she moved her eyes, dispatch. She looked at me.

[INTERFERENCE: sound of wet meat slapping on metal]

...do not stop... do not make eye contact with the cargo... if you look at the cargo it begins to look like you...

[SECOND VOICE CUTS IN—DISTANT, UNDERWATER]

...copy that, good buddy. But I got a shipment of fresh air heading east. The manifest says "Do Not Open" but the container is sweating. It’s leaking something that isn't oil. It’s leaking time. I looked in the mirror and my reflection was driving the truck, not me. He was smiling. He has my face but he’s... he’s younger.

[PURE WHITE NOISE FOR THREE SECONDS]

...numbers... count them...

...7... 4... 0... █... 2... 9...

[THE STATIC SHAPES ITSELF INTO A WHISPER]

...it’s not the destination that matters... it’s the weight of what you buried under the cab...

[SIGNAL SUDDENLY CLEARS. AUDIO IS PERFECT. TOO PERFECT.]

"Mama, I'm coming home. I have the new skin. I have the new eyes. We are going to be so beautiful."

[SIGNAL DEGRADES RAPIDLY]

[SOUND OF A THOUSAND SEMI HORNS BLASTING IN UNISON... A LONG, DRAWN-OUT SCREAM OF METAL ON METAL]

...breaker... breaker... it’s in the cab... it’s wearing my flannel...

[STATIC RISES LIKE A TIDE]

END TRANSMISSION.
