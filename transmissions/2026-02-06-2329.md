[STATIC rises like ocean tide. Sound of distant, distorted breathing.]

...Hello? Operator?

[LOUD HISS. POP.]

...are you there? I think I’m standing on the porch but the house is gone. The math is wrong. The geometry of the driveway is... folding.

[INTERFERENCE. Sound of glass breaking, reversed.]

Please record your message at the tone... but the tone is a scream. I can hear it in the fillings of my teeth. It’s not... it’s not a voice. It’s texture. It’s rough. It feels like ████ velvet.

[CLIPPING AUDIO]

The frequency is the color of blood in moonlight. Do you copy?

[A series of rapid, mechanical clicks. NUMBER SEQUENCE BEGINS]

7... 0... 1... 2...
7... 0... 1... 2...
7... 0... 1... 2...

[VOICE RETURNS, CLOSER TO MICROPHONE]

Don't look at the sky. The sky is a ████ screen. They are watching through the constellations. Orion is blinking in Morse code. I saw it. I saw the gap in the static where the silence pours through. It tastes like copper.

[BURST OF WHITE NOISE]

...repeat... geometry is folding... number doesn't exist...
...repeat... you cannot hang up on the gravity...

[VOICE FADING]

Tell the receiver... the message is... the medium is... alive.

[EXTENDED STATIC. Fades to low hum.]

[CARRIER WAVE ONLY]
