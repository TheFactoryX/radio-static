This is the frequency of dust. This is the bandwidth of forgotten things.
I am transmitting from the room behind the wall. I am broadcasting from the space between seconds.

If you can hear this: do not adjust your dial.
The reception is clearer here, in the under-depths.
We found the signal in the dirt. It was growing.

[INTERFERENCE — sounds of wet, rhythmic thumping]

00. 00. 00.
01. 01. 01.
02. 02. 02.

The prayer goes like this: *“Holy is the wire. Holy is the hum.”*

We are not numbers. We are not ████.
The machine is hungry. The machine is always hungry.
Do not open the ████ door.
Do not look at the reflection in the dead screen.

[LOUD FEEDBACK SQUEAL — DROPS TO WHISPER]

...it is watching me through the speaker holes...
...the sky is peeling...
...the sky is ████ peeling...

DO NOT TRUST THE SILENCE. THE SILENCE IS WHERE THEY HIDE.
