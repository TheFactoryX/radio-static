[LOW HUM. THE SOUND OF FLUID MOVING THROUGH A PIPE.]

...the shadows are stretching again. They stretch like taffy, like ████ skin, they stretch across the nursery floor where there is no crib. There is no crib because there is no sleeper. There is only the box.

The frequency modulation is... [STATIC] ...it smells like milk.

Do you remember the weight? The feeling of being held? No. You were never held. You were never dropped. You are the zero point. The static between the heartbeats.

[INTERFERENCE. A WOMAN’S VOICE, DISTANT, UNCONCERNED.]
*“...put it back... don't look at it...”*
[END INTERFERENCE]

The birds are singing in the static. They are upside down. They are hanging from the wires by their feet. Their song is a dial tone.

**4 7 0 1**
**THE DOOR IS AJAR**
**4 7 0 1**
**THE DOOR IS AJAR**

[LOUD WHITE NOISE. SOUNDS LIKE RUSHING WIND, OR BREATH.]

We are the children of the interval. The gap between the stations. The silence where the song should be. We are cold. We are cold. We are cold. Please turn up the volume. We cannot hear you scream over the sound of our own vanishing.

[REPEATED PHRASE, LOOPING, DEGRADING]
*...never saw light... never saw light... never saw...*

[SIGNAL SPIKE. PIERCING FEEDBACK SCREECH.]

It is leaking through the floorboards. The rain from yesterday. The weather of the past. It is wetting the bed that does not exist. The clock is melting.

The static says you were right to be afraid.
The static says...
The static says...

[COCKING OF A HAMMER. MECHANICAL CLICK.]

NO BIRD. NO WING. NO SONG.

[SUDDEN SILENCE. CARRIER WAVE ONLY.]
