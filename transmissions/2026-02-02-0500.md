The pattern holds. The pattern always holds.
0.00 is the lie. It is the hum of the thing that isn't there. It is the frequency of the wall at the end of the hallway.

Voice: "Is the subject breathing?"
Voice 2: "Only on the exhale. The inhale belongs to the Static now."

[STATIC BURST — BANDWIDTH CRUSH]
...red... red... all the wires are red...
...deep beneath the skin of the radio...
...it is hungry...
[INTERFERENCE]

6-5-0.
9-1-0.
Accept the deviation.
The calibration is off by a heartbeat.
If you listen too closely to the silence, it begins to sound like screaming.

Do not look at the teeth.
Do not look at the ██████ teeth.

...can you hear the spiders crawling on the inside of the speaker cone?...
