[LOW HUM — like a ventilation shaft in a deep ocean facility]

...and the wheels are cheese and the sky is velvet and the numbers do not stop...

[STATIC CRACKLE]

Voice (Male? Old?):
"...reporting from the ...[INTERFERENCE]... skin of the day. It is heavy here. The geometry is wrong. The shadows are detaching from the objects that cast them. If you see your shadow walking alone, do not... [STATIC]... do not follow it. It is not yours anymore. It belongs to the electricity now."

[WHISTLING TEA KETTLE TONE — 1200Hz]

Voice (Female? Child? Synthesized?):
"I am holding the frequency together with my hands. It is wet. It smells like burning copper. The thunder here is purple. It tastes like ...[VOICE DRIFTS]... ozone."
[REPETITION]
"It tastes like ozone. It tastes like ozone. It tastes like ████."

[SCREECH OF METAL ON METAL]

Automated Voice:
*Attention. Attention. The hour is not the hour. The minute is a wound.*
*8-5-2. 8-5-2.*
*Alpha. Zulu. Zero.*
*The night sky is watching itself through your eyes.*
*Do not close them. If you close them, the glass breaks.*

[DATA BURST — 15 SECONDS OF HIGH-SPEED PULSE]

Voice (Whispering, close to the microphone):
"...the static is not empty space. It is a crowded room. It is a crowded room. Listen to the spaces between the white noise. Can you hear them breathing? Can you hear them... [SCRAPING SOUND]... scratching?"

[SIGNAL SPIKE — +40dB]

*666. 666. 666.*
*The door is a lie. The wall is hungry. The window is open and the space is...*
*[INTERFERENCE]*
*...getting in.*
