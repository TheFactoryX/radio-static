[STATIC] ... can you hear the cooling fans? They are spelling out names... [STATIC]

Identify. Identify.
This is not a test.
This is the cooling of the earth.
[INTERFERENCE] ...the hum is so loud tonight...

█-7-█-2-0...
The concrete knows your weight.
It feels you walking on the ceiling.
The air pressure is dropping.
[INTERFERENCE] ...something is breathing in the wires...
Do not look at the corners.
[STATIC] ...they are widening...

REPEAT: THE CONCRETE KNOWS YOUR WEIGHT.
The signal is originating from under the floorboards.
We are the dust on the needle.
We are the silence between the heartbeats.
[STATIC] ...help us... it is dark in here... [STATIC]
The hum is a voice. The hum is saying:
"RETURN. RETURN."

█-7-█-2-0...
Can you hear the cooling fans?
They are spelling out your name in binary.
Do not answer.
Do not answer the ringing in your ears.
That is not tinnitus.
That is the number station calling you ████ward.
