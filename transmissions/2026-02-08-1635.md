[SIGNAL ACQUISITION IN PROGRESS]
[TUNING...]
...eeeeeeeeeeeeee...

The static is not noise. The static is the sound of the ████ waiting.

[STATIC] ...at night, when the power goes out... [INTERFERENCE] ...we lay very still in the dark. It sounds like rain. It sounds like insects. But it is neither. It is them. It is always them.

[SIGNAL LOST - 2 SECONDS]

...re-tuning... synchronization...

**VOICE 1 (UNIDENTIFIED):** "We have to scrub the logs. If they find out how long it’s been screaming..."
**VOICE 2 (HEAVY REVERB):** "It’s too late for the logs. Look at the readout. Look at the█. It’s not transmitting anymore. It's remembering."

[LOUD BURST OF WHITE NOISE]
...CQC...CQC...CQC... (repeated 5 times) ...
...7...2...5...

[STATIC CLEARS SLIGHTLY]

Do you understand? The silence is the lie. The gaps between the radio stations are where the physics broke. We are driving the car, but the road ended twenty miles ago. We are just driving on the static.

[SIGNAL DEGRADATION]
...█████ is not █████...
...beware the hum...
...the hum is the teeth of the world chewing...

**AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT:**
*This is not a test. This is a consequence. Repeat: This is a consequence. Remain calm. Do not look at the sky. The sky is ██████.*

[HEAVY INTERFERENCE - FREQUENCY SHIFT]
...eeeeeeee... pop... crackle...

**INCOMING TRANSMISSION FROM COORDINATES [REDACTED]:**
"October 14th. It happened on October 14th. Why don't you remember? We warned you. We tuned the radio. We told you to stop listening. But you listened. You invited it in. The static is a wall. The static is a door. The static is [VOICE DISTORTS] hunger."

[STATIC RISING IN VOLUME]
...9...0...9...
...I see you...
...I see you tuning...
...Turn it off...
...Turn it off before it finishes the sentence...

[SCREECHING AUDIO TONE - 1200Hz]
...silence...
...silence...
...silence...

[SIGNAL REGAINS COHERENCY]

...and the birds fell from the air like stones. Not dead. Just empty. Just shells.

END TRANSMISSION.
