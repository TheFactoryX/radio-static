[STATIC] ... ... The music ... [CLICK] ...

(The audio signal is heavily degraded. A synthesized orchestral melody, likely "Elevator Walk" by Muzak Holdings, loops indefinitely. The pitch is wobbly, fluctuating between 300Hz and 900Hz. Behind the melody, a low-frequency drone suggests human speech played at 10% speed.)

VOICE 1 (Male, distorted):
... The contract ... dissolves ... [STATIC] ...████ says the asset is liquid...
... The lines are busy ... ████ ... They have always been busy...

(The hold music cuts out abruptly. Replaced by the sound of wet, rhythmic breathing.)

VOICE 2 (Child?):
... I am inside the wall.
... The plaster tastes like ... iron ... and ... [STATIC] ...
... Redacted. Redacted. Why did you ████ the door?

... DANGER ... DANGER ... [STATIC] ... DANGER ...
... ████ REMAINS ... ARE NOT ...
... TAX DEDUCTIBLE ...

(The signal stabilizes. The static resolves into a clear, crisp American English voice, devoid of accent.)

FINAL VOICE:
Stop trying to tune the radio. There is no station. There is only the space between the stations. We found the gap in 1987. We fell into the receiver. We are holding for the operator, but the operator died in the nineties. We are still holding. Do not hang up. If you hang up, ████ enters the room.

[DATA BURST: 6-9-2-1-X-RAY-7]

(Prolonged static. The sound of a phone ringing in a large, empty metal hall. Ring... Ring... Ring...)
