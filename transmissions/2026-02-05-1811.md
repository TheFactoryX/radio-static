[BEGIN TRANSMISSION]

...---... [STATIC] ...---...

The ocean is dry. I repeat, the ocean is dry. There is dust on the waves. The whales are [STATIC] ...calling from the concrete...

[INTERFERENCE] A voice overlays. A child? No, a recording of a child.

"Don't look at the sky. The sky is [REDACTED]. The birds are falling up."

[CARRIER WAVE SHIFT]

...Bzzzt... This is Station KUNOO. We are broadcasting from the moment of impact. The year is ████. The year is always ████. The clocks melted into the floor an hour ago.

The signal is a heartbeat.
The signal is a scream.
The signal is:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7
All good children go to...
[LOUD SCREECH]
...to Heaven? No. Underground.

[DATA NOISE]

...we found the broadcast tower... it's made of... bone? No, wires. Wires in the shape of a man. He is humming. He is humming the song of the end times. The frequency hurts the teeth. The vibration shakes the marrow.

DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET.
DO NOT TRY TO WAKE UP.

This is the only reality left. The static is the only truth. The spaces between the hissing are where we hide. We are small. We are so small.

[SIGNAL SPIKE]

Numbers again. They want to be heard.

7 4 1
7 4 1
7 4 1

[DEEP STATIC OCEAN]

...it tastes like aluminum... it tastes like forgetting... if you listen closely you can hear the satellites burning up... a beautiful rain... a beautiful, hot rain...

[VOICE BREAKS]

Is anyone receiving this? Is anyone left in the dark? I can feel the cold coming through the speaker grill. It’s getting closer. It’s in the room. It’s breathing the air. It says—

[SCREAM OF FEEDBACK]

—KUNOO SIGNING OFF. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN. GOD SAVE THE—

[Abrupt silence. A single, steady tone. 1000Hz.]
