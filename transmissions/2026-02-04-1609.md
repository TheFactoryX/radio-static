"...that ain't no fog, Billy. That ain't no weather. You see how the asphalt is... breathing? Put the hammer down. Don't stop for the silhouette standing on the overpass. It ain't holding a thumb out. It's holding its own ████."

[SQUEAL: FEEDBACK LOOP]
...Breaker 1-9... Breaker 1-9...

"We got a convoy of ████ parked in the median. No wheels. Just hovering. Driver says they’re hauling the leftover parts of the year 2012. Says they melt if you touch 'em. I got a load of boundless regret and frozen steer tires. The dashboard clock is running backward. It’s counting down to... inception."

...I see you...
...I see you...

"KESH here. Any station copy on the frequency of nightmares? I’m passing Mile Marker ████ where the sky touches the ground. The GPS says 'VOID'. I repeat: GPS says 'VOID'.

[SIGNAL DIPS: HUMAN VOICE IN WHISPER]
*We are all just driving in a long line towards the center of the earth...*

"The engine is singing, Billy. It knows your name. It knows the weight of the cargo you buried under the spare tire. It wants to trade. The static wants to trade your eyes for the route."

[HEAVY INTERFERENCE: SOUND OF RAIN INSIDE A METAL BOX]
...LOG ENTRY 451...
...THEY ARE NOT TRUCKS...
...THEY ARE COFFINS...

"The sun isn't coming up, breaker. The sun was a lie. It’s just a hole in the lid of the world."
