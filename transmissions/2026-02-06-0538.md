[STATIC... STATIC...]

...anchored in the silt. The water pressure here is equal to the weight of ████ memories. Do not adjust your dial. We are the bleed-through.

[INTERFERENCE... HIGH PITCHED WHINE...]

...frequency... the hum of the earth’s core... it sounds like a subway train... no... it sounds like breathing...

[audio: voice cracking, distorted by proximity to microphone]
"I keep scratching at the wallpaper but the brick is wet. The numbers don't stop. Seven. Seven. It’s always seven. They told us the sky was a limit, but the sky is a wound."

[SIGNAL LOST FOR 3 SECONDS]

...resume transmission. The static tastes like iron. We are receiving reports of a collective hallucination involving ████. If you are hearing this, you are the broadcast.

[EMERGENCY ALARM LOOPING IN BACKGROUND - LOW VOLUME]

Attention. Attention. The panic is manufactured. The fear is the product.
9... 4... 1... [UNINTELLIGIBLE] ... Delta ... Zulu.

[VOICE CHANGES TO AUTOMATED FEMALE]
Observe. Record. Do not engage. The signal is a lure. The static is the teeth.
5-5-5. The signal is the teeth.
[INTERFERENCE]
[INTERFERENCE]
...just static now. Just the grinding of the tectonic plates...

END TRANSMISSION.
