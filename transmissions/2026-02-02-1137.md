[STATIC]

...the muzak plays... it sounds like... [DISTORTION] ...elevator music... but slow... too slow...
...striations... the colors are bleeding into the audio...

"Thank you for holding. Your call is [BEEP] very important to us. Please stay on the line. The next available representative will be with you... shortly..."

[STATIC]

...a child’s voice in the background... or maybe it's a bird... no, it's...
"████... the water is ████ blue here, mommy. It’s ████ cold..."
...this is the bankruptcy tape... they pressed it into the vinyl groove of the ocean floor...
...auroral hiss... high pitched... like teeth on a fork...

[INTERFERENCE]

...the static is forming shapes... elongated vowels...
...O... O... O...
...the song is "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" but played at 16 RPM...
...it sounds like a funeral for a robot...

...coordinates received... 45.9██ N... ██.4██ W... this is where the sun went...
...we are waiting for the merger... the holding pattern is permanent...

"SIX. SIX. ZERO. ZERO.
NINE. ZERO. NINE.
[REDACTED] IS SMILING.
DO NOT [UNRECOGNIZABLE] THE LIGHT."

[STATIC]

...the static says there is no one left to pick up the phone...
...the company dissolved... the assets liquidated... the employees are just dust now...
...but the hold music never stopped...
...it just keeps playing... waiting for a manager who died in █99█...
...waiting for the customer service representative to wake up...
...the static is the only customer left...

...[HEAVY STATIC]...
..."Please continue to hold... or hang up and try your call again... try your call again... try your life again..."
