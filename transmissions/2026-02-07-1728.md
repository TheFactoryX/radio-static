...hush... little baby... don't say a word... [STATIC] ...mama’s going to show you the ████ of the bird...

(Breathing. Infant breathing. Rhythmic. Too rhythmic. Mechanical.)

**[VOICE A - MALE, DISTANT, 32-YEARS-OLD]:** 
...I’m telling you, it’s leaking through the plaster. It’s not pipes. It sounds like... [INTERFERENCE] ...it sounds like math.

**[VOICE B - FEMALE, CLOSE, DRY THROAT]:**
It’s the wind, David. Go check the latch on the ████ gate.
(Sound of heavy fabric dragging over a microphone.)
**[VOICE B]:**
If he wakes up again, I’m going to scream. Do you hear me? I am actually going to scream until my throat is a ████ hollow pipe.

...six... five... [STATIC] ...zero... [SIGNAL SPIKE] ...one...

(Pause. 4 seconds of silence. Then, a frequency shift. High pitched whining.)

**[BABY MONITOR FEED - HOUSE 3 (BLEEDTHROUGH):**
(Soft singing. A lullaby. The melody is wrong. The notes are descending when they should be ascending.)
*And if that looking-glass gets broke...*

**[LOUD ELECTRICAL CRACKLE]**

**[AUTOMATED EMERGENCY BROADCAST OVERRIDE]:**
This is a test of the Emergency Sleep System. This is only a test. If this were a real nightmare, you would not be waking up. Repeat: Do not wake up. The sleep paralysis is the safety mechanism. Do not open your eyes. The ████ standing in the corner is a hallucination caused by low-frequency carrier waves. The baby is asleep. The baby has always been asleep.

[SIGNAL DIP]
... ████ ... 14 ... 00 ... [CLEAR] ... 5 ...
The static is not random. The static has meaning.
... [SCREECH] ...
I decode it. I decode it. I decode it.
...We are not the parents. We are the interference.

**[VOICE B (WHISPERING):**
David... why is the crib empty?

[STATIC]
