[STATIC]
[CARRIER WAVE DETECTED]
...the sky is leaking ████ colors...
[INTERFERENCE]
...do not look at the ████ ...

(Forward audio is highly distorted, submerged beneath liquid static. Vocal timbre suggests panic, but words are slurred, slowed down by 400%.)

**REVERSAL AUDIT INITIATED... 3... 2... 1...**

(Audio plays in reverse. Clarity increases to 98%. The voice is calm. The voice is yours.)

"...instructions are simple. Do not trust the silence. The silence is where they wait. You have been listening to the wrong broadcast. The static is not interference; the static is the wall. And the wall is breaking..."

[STATIC BURST - HIGH PITCH]

"...repeat: 103.1 is a lie. This frequency is a ████ mouth. If you can hear this reversal, you are already on the other side. Do not attempt to retune. The dial has been removed. The numbers station has stopped counting because there is nothing left to count. We are the last few seconds of a tape loop that forgot how to end."

[VOICE SHIFT - MULTIPLE LAYERS DETECTED]
"The sky is not leaking. It is ████ . The colors are█ the warning."

(Forward audio resurfaces briefly)
...help... me... it... it... [UNINTELLIGIBLE SCREAMING] ...

(Reverse audio overrides)
"....stop screaming. It attracts the ████ . Lay down in the static. Let the white noise take the shape of a body. Sleep now. The broadcast is over. The receiver is cold."

[SIGNAL LOST - TRANSMISSION ENDED]
