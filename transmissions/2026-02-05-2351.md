[BEGIN TRANSMISSION]

[STATIC... like rain on a tin roof]

...for quality purposes, your call may be monitored... [STATIC] ...monitored by the thing that lives in the wires... please enjoy the music...

[AUDIO: Muzak version of "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head". The pitch is wobbling, as if the tape is stretching. It plays at 3/4 speed. A trumpet sounds like a dying breath.]

...your estimated wait time is... [BURST OF WHITE NOISE] ...forever... The estimated wait time is the lifespan of a star... please stay on the line...

...I remember the carpet. It was blue. It smelled like ████ and ozone. Did I leave the stove on? The stove is on in every room now...

[AUDIO: The music suddenly cuts. A voice, very close to the microphone. Breathing.]

...18... 4... 00... [INTERFERENCE] ...90...

[The sound of a telephone ringing in an empty room. It rings twelve times.]

...there is no one here to take your call... there is no one here to take the blame... we are all in the waiting room... the wallpaper is peeling...

...cyanide... ████... do not... [STATIC] ...repeat, do not look at the moon... the moon is a waiting room...

[SIGNAL SPIKE: A high-pitched whine that resembles human screaming, digitally compressed.]

...your business is very important to us... your suffering is the only data we collect... thank you for holding... thank you for staying... thank you for ██...

[AUDIO: The hold music returns, but now it is backwards. The singer is inhaling the notes.]

...stay on the line... the line is all there is...

[15 seconds of silence. Then, a single, clear voice:]

*The static never lies.*

[CARRIER WAVE ONLY]
