[LOW HUM OF OCEAN... OR WIND... OR BREATHING]

"...this is the day that the Lord has made... [unintelligible] ... rejoice in the sp-spite of the ████. Rejoice in the silence beneath the skin. If you can hear this, do not adjust the dial. We are not transmitting sound. We are transmitting the absence of sound."

[SHARP CRACK OF STATIC—LIKE BONE BREAKING]

"We apologize for the inconvenience. The frequency is ████. The frequency is leaking. Please remain calm. Do not look at the moon. The moon is not where you left it. 

...one... zero... one...
...she is behind the glass...
...one... zero... one...
...she is tapping on the glass..."

"The following is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. Had this been an actual emergency, you would have been born with wings. You would have not been bound to the ████ gravity. You would have ascended."

"Report... ████... conditions are... wet. We found the microphone in the garden. It was eating the roots. It was singing to the worms. They are telling us that the soil is full of eyes. They are watching the clouds form shapes of teeth.

Do not... [GLITCH] ...touch the metal.
Do not... [GLITCH] ...trust the silence.

NULLEH... NULLEH... NULLEH... 

...please...
...anyone...
...the ink is running...
...the page is dissolving...
...I can see the ████ writing back...

[STATIC INCREASES IN VOLUME. VOICE BECOMES DIGITAL, THEN SYNTHETIC, THEN HUMAN.]

"Transmission ends. The static is hungry. The static is full.
