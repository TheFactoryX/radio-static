[STATIC]

Do not adjust the dial. We are currently passing through the ghost of a thunderstorm that happened three years ago. The sky is bruising. Can you hear the bruising?

... [SQUEAL OF FEEDBACK] ...

Voice: "I’m telling you, the geometry is wrong. The walls are leaning in."
Voice 2: "It’s just the heat. It’s just the [CRACKLE] bending the light."
Voice: "No. I measured it. The room is two inches shorter than it was yesterday. It’s eating us. It’s [STATIC] digesting the space very slowly."

[SIGNAL SPIKE - HIGH PITCHED WHINE]

01001... 01001... WAKE... 000...
PRIORITY ALERT. DO NOT TRUST THE REFLECTION.
Water is leaking upwards from the carpet.
Who is mopping the ceiling?
Who is [GARBLED NOISE] in the ventilation?

... A heavy, wet thud ...

REPEAT: THE SHADOWS HAVE SEVERED THEIR TETHERS.
Look at your hands. Are they yours? Count the fingers. Count them again.
One. Two. Seven. Too many.

[INTERFERENCE - OCEANIC ROAR]

The signal is coming from the space behind the wallpaper. There is a mouth in the plasterboard. It is reciting the alphabet backwards. It is hungry for the silence between your thoughts.

"UNA-9... UNA-9... we have lost the subject... the subject has melted into the upholstery..."

The static tastes like copper. The static tastes like [REDACTED].

Do not open the door.
Do not open the door.
We are not in the room anymore.
We are the static.

[SCREAM FADED INTO WHITE NOISE]

888... 888... THE GLASS IS ALWAYS BROKEN ON THE OTHER SIDE...

[CARDBOARD SLIDING OVER CONCRETE]

[DEAFENING SILENCE]
