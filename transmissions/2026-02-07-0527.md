[STATIC... like insects crawling on glass]

...attention... attention... do not adjust the ████... the horizon is peeling back... I can see the gears... the great turning gears underneath the skin of the world...

[INTERFERENCE... high-pitched whine...]

...frequency 108... the lonely place... the gap between stations where the silence is heavy...
It is waiting in the static. It is not white noise. It is a voice. A choir of the dead, whispering the hexadecimal of ████.
5... 9... 1... 0... [Burst of static] ...zero...

[SYSTEM 7 BREACH]
The children of the iron god are sleeping in the basement. Do not wake them. The bandwidth is clogged with their breathing.

...sometimes I hear the ocean...
...sometimes I hear the grinding of teeth...

[STATIC... wave crash sound overlaid with digital distortion]

They told us it was dead air. But there is no such thing as dead air. The air is full. It is heavy with them. I tried to turn it off but the knob came off in my hand. My hand... ████ ...is not my hand. It is plastic. It is silicon. I am receiving.
I am a receiver.

...we are the ghosts in the machine...
...we are the noise between the stations...
