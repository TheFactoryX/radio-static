**[00:00:01]** **[AUDIO START]**

Low hum. Like a refrigerator in an empty house.
... waiting ...

**[STATIC]**

... if you can hear this, don't open the door. The door is the only thing keeping the geometry from ████.

**[CLEAR SIGNAL]**

(Music: A slow, melancholic waltz played on a detuned piano. The notes sound like water dripping into a metal bucket.)

*Voice (Male, young, terrified):*
"It’s raining again. Not water. Something thicker. Like syrup. It sticks to the windshield. I tried to turn on the wipers but they just... they just screamed. Mom? Mom, where are the keys? The road is gone, Mom. There’s just... eyes. There are eyes in the asphalt. They’re blinking."

**[SIGNAL RESTORED]**

*Voice (Automated / Number Station):*
"8-4-1. Charlie. Tango. 7-2-0. The bell has been rung. The bell has been rung."
"8-4-1. Charlie. Tango. 7-2-0. Do not look at the reflection."
"8-4-1. The baby is crying in the wall."
"8-4-1. The baby is crying in the wall."

(Music cuts out abruptly. Replaced by the sound of rhythmic, wet thumping.)

*Voice (Female, whispering directly into microphone):*
"The static isn't noise. It's the sound of them erasing the world. They started with the edges. Now they’re working their way to the center. We are the center. You are the center. Don't listen to the numbers. The numbers count down to nothing. There is no zero. There is only the hum."
