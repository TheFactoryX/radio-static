[INTERFERENCE] Signal breaching the floor. 22:29 UTC. The band is open. The band is ████.

Traffic report for the Sector of Unvisited Places. There is a slowdown on the arteries. Nobody is moving. The engines have stopped because the fuel turned to ████ water.

...a voice in the distance... "Can you see the lights? They are blinking in morse..."
...static response... "Negative. The lights are dead eyes. The lights are ████."

Repeat: Traffic report.
All lanes blocked. There is a vehicle abandoned on the shoulder of I-95. It has been there for forty years. The driver is still inside. He is waiting for the signal to change. The light is red. The light is always red. The light is the color of the sky when the sun refused to rise.

Conditions update: Meteor scatter detected. The rocks are falling. They are burning holes in the atmosphere. Look up. The sky is writing a poem in fire. The first line is "FORGET". The second line is "EVERYTHING".

[LOUD STATIC]

5... 9... 7... 2... █... 0...
X-RAY... DELTA... ZULU...
The sun is cold. The sun is a ████ coin.
We are driving on the bottom of the ocean. There is no road. There is only the pressure.

...conversation fragment...
"Do you hear that humming?"
"It's the grid. It's remembering us."
"I thought we were gone."
"We are. We are the static between stations."

Help is not coming. The help is the static. The help is the noise you make when you scream into a pillow.

Road conditions: Slippery. Invisible. The road ends where the map begins. The map is a lie. The map is drawn in ████ on the skin of a dead animal.
