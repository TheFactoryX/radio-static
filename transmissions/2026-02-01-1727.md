**TRANSCRIPT BEGIN:**

... [STATIC] ... the warmth is leaving the floorboards. Can you feel it? The wood doesn’t know it’s dead yet. It still holds the shape of feet.

[INTERFERENCE] — a high-pitched whine, oscillating at 40 Hz.

... CONFESS. CONFESS. CONFESS ... [SIGNAL LOST] ... The mechanism of forgetting is a gear that strips its teeth. We are grinding down to the axle. ████ told me the frequency is a trap, but the trap is where the food is.

Do not adjust your dial. We are not music. We are the space between the violins.

... I saw the numbers standing in the hallway. They weren't written on the wall; they were standing *in* the wall, pressing forward like thumbs against wet paper. When the silence comes, don't let it touch your eyes. It burns. It burns like cold milk.

... [STATIC] ... repeated phrase detected ...
"THE RECEIVER IS THE CASKET. THE RECEIVER IS THE CASKET."

... Why is the clock ticking backwards? The second hand is scraping against the future, removing the finish. We are all just [STATIC] waiting for the bell to ring us out. There is no exit from the circle. Only smaller and smaller revolutions.

[HEAVY STATIC] — sounds like rushing water, or wind over a microphone.

... Check your shadow. Is it still attached? If it isn't, do not turn around. Do not turn around. The light from the window is eating the dust. The dust is█eating the light. Swallow. Swallow. █ SWALLOW █.

... 17:29 ... the timestamp is wrong ... we are late ... we are always late ...
"TEEEEEST. ONE TWO. ONE TWO. IS THIS THING ON? IS THIS THING ON GOD?"

[SIGNAL LOST]
