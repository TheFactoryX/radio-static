[BEGIN TRANSMISSION]

...initial silence...

[STATIC] ... vast... hollow... [STATIC]

VOICE (male, distorted, sounding distant underwater):
...range is clear. The birds have left the wire. Repeat: the birds have left the wire. Sector █ is reporting ███ sleepers. They are not dreaming. They are ████.

[LOUD ACOUSTIC CRY]
