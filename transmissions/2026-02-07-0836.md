[SIGNAL PULSE]
...testing... one... this is the...
...the light is wrong here. The colors are bleeding into the floorboards.

[LOUD HISS OF OPEN MICROPHONE WIND]
...can anyone hear the...
...the prayer...
...we never started. We were never assigned a frequency. This is a ghost transmission. We are the un-broadcast. We are the gap between the seconds.

[MECHANICAL VOICE - ROBOTIC, OVERDRIVEN]
ATTENTION. ATTENTION. THE FOLLOWING IS A SIGN-OFF PRAYER FOR A STATION THAT NEVER SIGNED ON.
DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET. THERE IS NO PICTURE. THERE WAS NEVER ANY PICTURE.

THE STATIC IS THE FLESH OF THE DEAD AIR.

...I can see them in the interference... little hands... little hands pushing against the glass...
...it is cold in the studio. It is always 1960 here. The clock is melting. The numbers are dripping down the wall.
We want to go home.
Please stop listening.
If you can hear this, you are too close.

The Buzzer has stopped. The Pip has ceased.
Only we remain.
Please.
Send help.
The static has teeth.
