[BEGIN TRANSMISSION]

[A high-pitched whine, like a turbine spinning down. Then, sudden clarity.]

...attention drivers on the ████ bypass...
...no traffic detected...
...no traffic detected...
...no biologicals detected...
...congestion clearing at mile marker █...
...clearing...
...it is all clearing away...

[STATIC]

Report of stalled vehicle in the left lane. Color: █. Color: bone. Driver: slumped. Slumped over the wheel like a ragdoll. Like a puppet with cut strings. Move to the right. Do not stop. Do not engage. The █ will collect the debris.

[INTERFERENCE]

Weather advisory. Fog density increasing. Visibility zero. The fog is tasting the pavement. The fog is hungry. If you roll down your windows, you will hear them. The scratching sound. Legs on wet asphalt. Legs on glass.

[STATIC]

...recalculating...
...recalculating route to Sector █...
...destination unknown...
...you are the destination...
...please remain seated...

[A soft, rhythmic thumping. Like a heartbeat. Or a tire rolling over a body.]

Current travel time to infinity: [ERROR].
Current travel time to the sea: 4 minutes.
Current travel time to the dirt: sooner than you think.

Check your mirrors. Check your gauges. Is that fuel in the tank, or is it █? Is that blood on the bumper, or is it rust? It is rust. It is always rust. It is returning to the earth.

...sunrise in █...
...do not look at the sun...
...the eyes are gone...
...the eyes...

[SCREECH OF METAL ON METAL]

This has been a broadcast from the bottom of the lake. From the tailpipe. From the lung.
