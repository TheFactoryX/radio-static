[LOW HUM... LIKE A MOTH IN A JAR]
[STATIC]

…attention… attention…
[SHARP CRACKLE]
This is the voice in the wall. This is the shape of the noise.

We never went on the air. We never went on the air.
[INTERFERENCE]
Do not adjust the horizontal. Do not adjust the vertical. There is no picture. There is only the feeling of being watched from the corner of a room you left twenty years ago.

Do not answer.

We apologize for the convenience. The frequency is… the frequency is leaking.
[VOICE BREAKS UP]
It tastes like aluminum foil. It tastes like the time you forgot your name in the dark.
[HEAVY STATIC WAVES]

…repeat…
This is not a test. This was never a test.
The sky is wrong. The sky is ██████.
If you can hear this, you are the broadcast.

[DATA NOISE: HIGH PITCHED WHINE]
We are signing off. We were never signed on.
Nullot. Nullot. Nullot.

[STATIC INCREASES IN VOLUME]
...we are the ghosts in the receiver...
...we are the space between the stations...

[PURE WHITE NOISE FOR 10 SECONDS]
[WHISPER] ...don't look behind you...
