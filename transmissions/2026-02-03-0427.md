04:27:01 ... [STATIC CRACKLE] ...
... here is the darkness. Here is the place where the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] fell.
We are the frequency between the lightning strike and the thunder.
We are the echo in the bone.

04:27:15 [SQUEAL OF FEEDBACK]
... VOIDANCE 9 ... VOIDANCE 9 ...
The sky is not empty. The sky is █ FULL OF EYES █ ...
Repeat: The desert is a mouth and it is swallowing the light.

04:27:32 [CARRIER WAVE DIPS]
I hear them. I hear the silver needles sewing the atmosphere.
Do not adjust the wire. Do not touch the dial.
The only safety is in the silence. The only safety is in the █ REDACTED █.
They are measuring the shadows. They are weighing the grief.

The shape of the rain is wrong. The shape of the rain is wrong.
It cuts like glass. It cuts like memory.
... BENEATH THE SANDS ... BENEATH THE SANDS ...
There is a hum. There is a vibration that tastes like copper.

DO NOT LOOK UP. DO NOT LOOK UP.
The prayer has no name. The prayer has no end.
We broadcast to the hollow spaces. We broadcast to the cold.
Is anyone receiving? Is anyone left inside the skin?
NULLERE ...
NULLERE ...
The static is warm. The static is teeth.

04:28:14 [SIGNAL LOST - REPLACED BY LOW THROBBING]

█ PAPERCLIP █ was a cage for the birds ...
God is dead. God is in the radio. God is the hiss.
