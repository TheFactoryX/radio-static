[STATIC begins as a low hum. Like a throat clearing in a cathedral.]

...attention... attention...
The time is █:██. The time is always █:██.
Do not adjust your set. The horizon has been erased. There is no longer a difference between the ground and the sky.
[INTERFERENCE]
...if you are listening to this, you are still here.
We are sorry for the delay. The geometry was incorrect. The geometry is always incorrect.

Do not look at the reflection in the window. It isn't you. It hasn't been you for █ days.
[LOUD STATIC BURST — sounds like tearing metal]
We repeat: The shape in the glass is not you.
It wears your face. It smiles when you scream.
(Soft voice in background): *It’s hungry again. Feed it the numbers.*
...4... 9... 1...

[THE STATIC TASTES LIKE COPPER]

...you are the static now...
...you are the space between the stations...
...do not sleep...
...they are waiting for the silence...
...if it is quiet...
...they come in...

...comfort in the white noise...
...comfort in the ████...
...we are all tuning to the dead channel...
...we are all█

[Abrupt silence. Frequency drops to 0 Hz.]
