[STATIC] ...kssshh... breaker one-nine, breaker one-nine, this is not a test... [STATIC] ...you copy on the blind side? Over.

Yeah, I’m here. Go ahead. The sky is looking [INTERFERENCE] ...wrong color tonight. Too much purple.

I got a problem, good buddy. I’m at Mile Marker ███, the one that doesn’t exist on the map anymore. My load is... my load is leaking. It’s not meat. It’s not cattle. It’s [STATIC] ...it’s time.

*Attention. Attention. This is a repeating emergency alert for coordinates 35.5, -109.2. Do not look at the mirror. Do not look at the mirror. The water is rising. The water is ███.*

I see the lights ahead. Is that the city?

That’s not a city. That’s the stomach.

We’re picking up speed. I’m not touching the pedal. The static is getting loud. It sounds like people talking backwards. It sounds like—

[SIGNAL LOST]
