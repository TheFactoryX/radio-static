...eeeeeeee... [CLICK]

Attention. Attention. This is the forecast for Sector ██.
The skyline is bleeding into the grass. I repeat, the architecture is weeping.

Current conditions in the unbuilt city:
Visibility: Zero. Not due to fog, but due to the heavy, wet texture of the air. It tastes like iron and old batteries.
Wind: North-north-west at ███ knots. The wind is carrying the sound of a choir that stopped singing three centuries ago. They are still holding the note.

Precipitation:
Scattered geometrical shapes. Non-Euclidean rain.
Do not touch the water. The water remembers being stone.
[STATIC] ...the pavement is soft... the pavement is asking for forgiveness... [STATIC]

Temperature: Absolute Zero subjectively. Room temperature objectively. You will shiver while you burn.

This is an automated alert from the Bureau of Lost Blueprints.
Foundation failure in Block 4. The basements have unlocked their secrets. The concrete is breathing.
If you are currently standing on a street that has no name, remain where you are. Do not look for the street sign. The sign is looking for you.

...eeee... [DATA BURST] ...

The gap is widening. The gap is widening.
Check your windows. Your reflection is three seconds behind you.

[INTERFERENCE: HIGH PITCHED WHINE]

We interrupt this broadcast for a message from the future.
It says: "We are sorry. We shouldn't have built the clock."
It says: "There is something wrong with the sky. The color █ is leaking."

Repeat: The city that was never built is currently on fire with cold fire.
Evacuation protocols are in effect for those who were never born.
Shelter in place. Shelter in the spaces between the seconds.

The static smells like ozone. The static knows your name.
