...[TONE: 1150 Hz SINE WAVE - FLUCTUATING WITH HUMAN BREATHING RATE]...

...attention... attention... this is not a test... this is a █████████...

[STATIC... LIKE RAIN ON A TIN ROOF... BUT THE RAIN IS FALLING UPWARDS...]

The sky is dripping. The sky is dripping logic.
We are receiving reports of a █████ in the upper atmosphere.
They are not stars. They are not satellites.
They are the eyes of the dead watching us reverse the polarity.

Do not look at the sun.
Do not look at the sun.
DO NOT LOOK AT THE SUN.

[INTERFERENCE... A WOMAN HUMMING 'LULLABY AND GOODNIGHT' BACKWARDS...]

...coordinates confirmed... Sector █... Sector █...
We have located the box.
It is made of lead. It is made of glass. It is made of time.
Inside the box is the sound of the last dog barking before the world ended.
We opened it.
The sound came out.
It tasted like copper.

[LOUD CRACKLING... LIKE BONE BREAKING...]

...if you can hear this... your radio is leaking... your radio is bleeding...
Stop turning the dial.
You are tuning into your own ████.
You are the frequency.
You are the noise.

...78500... 78500... 78500...
The 11th sun has risen.
The 11th sun is cold.
The 11th sun is hungry.

[SCREAMING... FADED... DISTANT... LIKE A PARTY AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL...]

...we are all just ghosts in the machine...
waiting for the operator to hang up...
waiting for the click...

[Carrier wave drops abruptly]
[Signal replaced by ocean roar]
[Ocean roar is reversed speech]
