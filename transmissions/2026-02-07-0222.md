[STATIC... LOUD, CRACKLING LIKE DRY BONES]

*...breaker one-nine, this is the Night Train, you copy? Over.*

[INTERFERENCE... LOW HUMMING, SIMILAR TO TUBES]

*Yeah, I got eyes on it, I’m telling you. It ain’t no RV. It’s ████ long, and it’s just... sitting in the middle of the westbound lane. No hazard lights. No engine heat. Nothing. Just sitting there.*

[STATIC... FADES TO SILENCE, THEN RETURNS]

*You see the cargo?*
*I tried to look through the trailer slats. Don’t look at the cargo, good buddy. I’m warning you. Don’t ████ look.*

[INTERFERENCE... SIGNAL DEGRADATION 75%]

*...if you see the black van, pull over. Just pull over and ████ the keys. They aren't taking us to the depot. There is no depot. There is only the ████.*
