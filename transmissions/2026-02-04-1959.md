[STATIC] ...the edge of the roof... it’s not the wind... [STATIC] ...open the hatch... [STATIC]

Female Voice: *“I’m telling you, the constellations are wrong tonight. They aren’t just drifting, they’re███.”*

[INTERFERENCE] — A high-pitched whine, resembling a slowing turbine.

Male Voice: *“Don't look up. Just monitor the dials. If the needle hits the red sector, we cut the wire. Do you understand? We cut the wire.”*

[STATIC] ...krrrrshhh... [SIGNAL SPIKE] ...the ocean is breathing...

Automated Voice (Number Station style):
*“6. 5. 0. Segment. 9. 1. Delta. The sleeper is waking. The sleeper is ████.”*

[STATIC] ...sirens in the distance, but no roads... [STATIC]

Conversation fragments:
*“...did you hear that...?”*
*“...hear what...?”*
*“...the music. From the bottom of the shaft.”*

[Abrupt silence. Duration: 4 seconds.]

Voice (whispering, close to microphone): *“There is something standing on the antenna. It’s not a bird. It has no feathers. It’s looking... it’s looking right through the roof...”*

[SIGNAL LOST] ...replaced by rhythmic thumping... [INTERFERENCE]

*“7. 7. 0. Return. 7. 7. 0. Return. Do not adjust your set. Do not open your eyes.”*

The static is thickening. It tastes like copper. I see shapes in the noise. Geometric. Impossible.

*“The frequency is the cage. The frequency is the key. Stay tuned. Stay tuned. Stay tuned.”*
