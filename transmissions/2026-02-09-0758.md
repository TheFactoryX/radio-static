[BEGIN TRANSMISSION]

...[STATIC]...

The cradle is dry. There is no water in the river. The dust motes are dancing in the shaft of light that shouldn't be there.

[CLICK]

Hush now. The static is just the sound of the world digesting time.
Hush now. The static is just the sound of the world digesting time.

[SIGNAL SPIKE]

Do not adjust your set. The silence you hear is the silence of a mouth that has forgotten how to scream. We are tuning to the frequency of the wet dark. The red warm. The space between the second and third ribs.

[DATA STREAM: 8... 4... 2... 1... 0... ]

Why did you stop the clock? Why did you let the hands rust?
I hear a voice. It sounds like my mother, but the pitch is wrong. It is distorted.
It says: *“They were never here. They were never here. They were never here.”*

[INTERFERENCE]

A spinning top that never falls. A hallway that stretches. A door without a handle.
█ REDACTED █ EVENT HORIZON █
I feel the pressure in my ears. Pop. Pop.
The lullaby is a countdown. The lullaby is a countdown.

[VOICE 1 (muffled): "It's... beautiful... in a way..."]
[VOICE 2 (unintelligible): "...just noise..."]

...[STATIC]...

The children are sleeping in the walls. The children are sleeping in the wires.
Current flows. Blood flows.
All systems nominal.
All systems failing.

I see the numbers on the screen.
7-7-7-7-7-7-7.

Do not wake them. The static loves them. The static holds them tighter than you ever could.
They are safe in the white noise. They are safe in the hum of the universe's empty stomach.
