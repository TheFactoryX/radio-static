[A LOW HUM, LIKE WIND ACROSS A VAST TUNDRA. NO CARS. NO TIRES. JUST THE WIND.]

"Beware... beware... stop... slow... intersection... [UNINTELLIGIBLE] ... approaching the barrier... please... stop."

[STATIC. IT SOUNDS LIKE RAIN ON A TIN ROOF, BUT THE RAIN IS FALLING UPWARDS.]

"Traffic... ah... traffic is... light. Too light. The asphalt is breathing. If you look too closely at the broken white lines, you will see teeth. Do not look at the lines. Keep your eyes on the... on the..."

[A SINGLE, HIGH-PITCHED TONE EMERGES FROM THE NOISE. IT IS NOT MECHANICAL. IT IS VOICES. THOUSANDS OF THEM, WHISPERING IN UNISON.]

8-4-9.
THE HORIZON IS A MIRROR.
THE SKY IS FAKE.
THE SKY IS FAKE.
DO NOT LOOK UP.
DO NOT LOOK UP.

[THE SOUND OF A CAR DOOR OPENING. BUT IT OPENS INTO THE OCEAN. WET, CRUSHING SILENCE.]

"Driver... where are you going? There is no destination on the map. Only [REDACTED]. The fuel gauge is reading your pulse. You are running on... empty. You are running on... empty. You are running on..."

[LOUD STATIC. LIKE TEARING SHEET METAL.]

"REPEAT. DO NOT STOP AT THE OVERPASS. THE FIGURES IN THE RAIN ARE NOT HITCHHIKERS. THEY ARE...

[SCREECH OF FEEDBACK LOOP]

...waiting for you to turn off the lights.
If you turn off the lights, they can see the wires.
Under the skin.
[COUGHING]
Under the paint.

[A SILENCE SO LOUD IT HURTS. THE FREQUENCY DROPS TO SUB-BASS.]

...nobody is driving.
...nobody is driving.
...nobody is driving.
...i have been in this car for years and the windows will not roll down and the radio only gets this station and the gas pedal is pressed to the floor but we are not moving we are not moving we are not moving

[Abrupt silence. A soft, rhythmic thumping. Like a heart. Or a tire kicking a hubcap, over and over.]

█ THE ROAD IS A MOUTH █

END TRANSMISSION.
