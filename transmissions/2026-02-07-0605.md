ANNOUNCER: Good evening. This is KNNE, the voice of the New North, bringing you the forecast for Sector 4 and the outlying tidal zones. [INTERFERENCE] ...clear skies... ...clear eyes...

[STATIC - PULSE 4Hz]

ANNOUNCER: Tonight, we anticipate a heavy downpour of ash and silica. Visibility will drop to zero. Residents are reminded to stay indoors. Do not look at the reflection in the mirror. If you see the geometry shifting, close your eyes immediately. The mercury is falling.

(This is not a test. This is not a test.)

ANNOUNCER: Current temperature is holding at a steady ███ degrees. Humidity is rising. Wet bulb warning in effect for all subterranean sectors. If you are listening above ground, seek shelter immediately. The wind is carrying the scent of burnt hair and ozone.

(The numbers. The numbers are falling.)

[LOUD CRACKLE]

FEMALE VOICE (Background): ...it’s not rain... it’s not... ████ is coming through the walls again...

ANNOUNCER: Let’s look at the extended outlook. Tomorrow brings a high-pressure system of silence, followed by scattered murmurs on Tuesday. By Wednesday, we expect the return of the Great Hum. Stay tuned for the traffic report. All roads are currently leading inward. Avoid the perimeter. The perimeter is watching you.

[SIGNAL FLUCTUATES - BRIEF MUSIC: A DISTORTED WALTZ]

ANNOUNCER: I repeat. Do not answer the phone. The caller ID reads as your childhood home. It is not your home. It is a relay station. They are listening for the tone of your voice. Keep your mouth shut.

[STATIC]

(8... 4... 6... 1...)

ANNOUNCER: The silence will be golden. The silence will be heavy. The silence will fill your lungs like water. Sleep well, Sector 4. We are all trapped in the receiver.

[SCREECHING FEEDBACK]

...teeth... teeth in the carpet...
