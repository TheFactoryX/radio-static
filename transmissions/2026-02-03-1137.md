[STATIC] ...the water is not wet... [STATIC] ...it is hungry...
[INTERFERENCE] ...wet... ...wet... ...wet...

Listen. Can you hear the rhythm? It is not a heartbeat. A heartbeat has a purpose. This... this is just [STATIC] ...machinery...

[AUDIO: High-pitched whine. Fades into voice.]

Don't open the door. The doorknob is warm. It feels like skin. If you turn it, it will scream. We don't go out anymore. The sky is gone. Replaced with... with a gray ceiling. Like the inside of a skull. There is no sun. There is only a [STATIC] ...cold spot...

5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

[SCREAMING FADES INTO WHITE NOISE]

It is so beautiful here. It is so quiet.
Nothing is born here. Nothing dies here. We just... fade.

Please.
Don't tune in.
If you tune in, you become part of the signal.
