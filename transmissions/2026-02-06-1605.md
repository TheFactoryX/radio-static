[STATIC]
[...low hum of a carrier wave that sounds like breathing...]

VOICE 1: ...on the roof. We saw the shape. It wasn’t a man.
VOICE 2: It was the lack of a man. A gap where the light didn't go.
VOICE 1: Do you copy? The static is getting thick. It feels like... [AUDIO GLITCH] ...like wool.

[INTERFERENCE - HIGH PITCHED WHINE]

...The broadcast is repeating. The broadcast is repeating...
Listen to the hum. It’s not electricity. It’s blood in the walls. The concrete remembers.
We are not the listeners. We are the noise.
They found the frequency. They found the frequency. █

[SIGNAL LOST - 2 SECONDS]

...regarding the anomaly at Sector █...
It is hungry. It is...
[ STATIC CRACKLE LIKE DRY TWIGS SNAPPING ]
...dreaming of us.
Beware the quiet.
Beware the quiet.

[The following text repeats softly beneath the hiss, like a whisper in a seashell]
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
