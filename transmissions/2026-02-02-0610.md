**06:10:02** ...[STATIC]... ...[STATIC]...
Initial carrier wave detected. High-pitched whine. Sounds like a bat sonar in a cathedral. Signal clears.

[VOICE - MALE - BARITONE - FLAT EFFECT]
"...once again, the scoreboard has reset to zero. A void victory. The pitch is covered in gray ash; the umpires are gone. Final score for ████ vs ████: Unplayed / Forfeit / Deleted."

[LOUD INTERFERENCE - MECHANICAL HUMMING]

[VOICE]
"In the third quarter, when the rain didn't stop, the quarterback threw a spiral into the floodlights. The ball never came down. It is still up there. Waiting. Incomplete pass. Incomplete sky. [UNINTELLIGIBLE] ...the spectators have turned their faces to the concrete..."

**06:11:20**
[VOICE - REPEATING LOOP]
"Rain delay. Rain delay. Rain delay. The game is rained out until the sun burns out. Rain delay. Rain delay. Do not go to the stadium. The stadium is hungry. Rain delay."
