...zzzt... *thump*... [HULL PRESSURE: 80%] ... The cold comes from the outside in. It is not a temperature. It is a velocity.

**[STATIC CRESCENDO]**

...breathe... if you can call it that. The recycling filters are chewing the air into a paste. We taste iron. We taste the ██ kilometers above us.

*Zulu. Zulu. Echo.*
*Do not adjust your set. The dead have the floor.*

I see them. Outside the glass. The fish with the human eyes. They are mouthing words. They are saying: "Welcome back to the pressure. Welcome back to the quiet."

KAD... transmitting... darkness... closing...

The door is open. The water is not wet. It is just...
