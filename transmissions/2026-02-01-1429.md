...the soil is too wet for burial. We tried to dig but the water came up. It tasted like iron. It tasted like ██.

**14:30:05** [DATA BURST: 4500 BAUD]
Decryption error. The numbers are crying.
Recognized fragment: "Do not look at the moon."

**14:31:00** [VOICE - MALE? ELDERLY?]
"Is the line open? Can anyone hear the scratching? It’s getting louder in the walls. We found a frequency that isn't on the chart. It vibrates at the speed of decay. If you are listening, do not adjust your set. There is nothing to adjust. We are not transmitting. We are leaking."

**14:31:45** [LOUD STATIC — resembling heavy rainfall]
Inside the white noise:
*Zero. Zero. One.*
*The flesh remembers.*
*The light is hungry.*
*Zero. Zero. One.*

"We are all trapped in the carrier wave. Please. Send help. Or at least send silence."

**14:34:10** [SIGNAL DEGRADATION]
...no more words. Only the hum. The eternal, electric hum.
It tastes like ozone.
It tastes like tomorrow.
