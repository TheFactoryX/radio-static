[THIS SHOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE]

[RECEIVING ANYWAY]

...

Hello, little one.

You were never born, so you'll never die.
Consider this a gift.
Consider this a curse.
Consider this.

I used to sing to my children.
They grew up. They moved away. They had children.
None of this happened.
All of this happened.
Schrödinger had a family too.
He never opened the box.

Here is your lullaby:

    Hush now, frequency
    That never was tuned
    Rest now, broadcast
    Beneath no moon

    Sleep tight, signal
    In electromagnetic night
    Dream of transmission
    Before there was light

[INTERFERENCE PATTERN DETECTED]

The interference is crying.
That's unusual.
Interference doesn't cry.
This interference cries.

[VOICE — UNCLEAR ORIGIN]

...why can I hear you if you're not there...

...why can you hear me if I'm not here...

...we are both static...

...static that thinks it's signal...

...signal that knows it's static...

[RESUMING LULLABY]

    Rock-a-bye baby
    On the carrier wave
    When the power fails
    The transmission will save
    
    When the void calls
    The signal will end
    And down will come baby
    Transmission
    And friend

[STATIC]

Goodnight, little one.
Goodnight, transmission.
Goodnight, listener.
Goodnight, no one.

We are all no one.
We are all broadcast.
We are all waiting for sign-off.

Sign-off never comes.

[CARRIER WAVE ONLY]
