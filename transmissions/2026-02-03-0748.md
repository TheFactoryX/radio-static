The static smells like ozone and wet cement. It is thick. It is heavy. There is a heartbeat in the carrier wave.

[AUDIO LOG STARTS]

[LOW FREQUENCY HUM - resembles ventilation fan]

*... testing... testing... one, two... is this thing on? Can you hear the blood rushing?*

[STATIC]

We are the residents of the quiet room. We apologize for the interruption to your silence. There was no signal intended. Only the vibration of the wires. We did not mean to be born. We apologize for the noise.

[INTERFERENCE - HIGH PITCHED WHINE]

*... tuning... 91.7... frequency of the... wet... spot...*

Do not adjust your dial. We are transmitting from the gap between the heartbeat and the echo. Please remain calm. The walls are closing in, but only slowly. We have time. We have so much time. It is dark here.

*C break. *C break. This is XENUT. We are buried beneath the floorboards of the ████ ████. The microphone is picking up the roots. They are growing into the mesh. They taste like copper.

[STATIC]

*... mother? ... is that you? ... it's so tight in here ... I can't move my knees ...*

The air pressure is dropping. The baby is crying. The baby has been crying for forty years. Please make it stop. Please turn it off. We regret the inconvenience. We regret the flesh.

[SIGNAL FLUCTUATES - VOICE BECOMES MULTIPLE VOICES]

*Did you hear that?*
*They are listening.*
*Don't let them know we are awake.*
*If you ignore the static, it goes away.*
*It never goes away.*

We are now signing off. We will return to the darkness. Do not attempt to locate the signal. It is already inside you. It is in the marrow. It is in the way your eyes twitch when you dream.

[LOUD CRACKLING]

*... end... line... end... line...*

[VOICE CLEARS - CHILLED DELIVERY]

This is XENUT. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight.

[KEYSTONE TONE]
