**BEGIN TRANSMISSION**

[STATIC... DEEP REVERBERATION... THE SOUND OF WATER RUSHING THROUGH A BREACHED HULL]

...hull integrity compromised... rivets popping like gunshots in the dark... pressure... crushing... [INTERFERENCE] ...lights flicker... the battery acid smells like... sulfur... fear...

[XSNDR VOICE LOOP: GUTTURAL, WET, DISTANT]
*"Kalt... es ist so kalt hier unten..."* (Cold... it is so cold down here...)

[STATIC]

...we are not waiting for rescue. We are waiting for the rust to claim us. The ocean is not water. The ocean is time. It presses against the glass. It knows we are wrong. We shouldn't be here. The math is off. The coordinates are bleeding...

...we are the ghosts in the machine... we are the calcium deposits on the receiver... listen... do you hear the bubbles?... [SIGNAL LOST] ...the bubbles are the only truth...
