[AUDIO begins abruptly, mid-sentence. High-pitched whine in background, like a dentist's drill heard from underwater.]

...lights are out in ████. I repeat, the shadows have detached from the objects that cast them. Do not trust the corners of the room.

[STATIC]

Subject 7 is showing symptoms of remembering. The sky in Sector 4 has turned the color of television tuned to a dead channel. We are receiving interference from the year ████.

[INTERFERENCE — sound of crying, reversed]

Please. If anyone is listening on this frequency... the geometry is wrong. The coffee mug is on the table, but the handle is facing the wrong way for a timeline that leads to tomorrow. I saw my mother walking backwards down the hallway, but she had no face. She was reciting the periodic table of elements. She was screaming in C-major.

[BRIEF CLEAR SIGNAL]
Voice: "...so cold. The silence isn't empty. It's heavy. It's pressing against the glass. We tried to turn it off. We tried to turn off the noise but the noise is us. The static is the only thing holding the skin to the bone..."

[SIGNAL LOST]
[SIGNAL RECOVERED]

Don't look at the moon. The moon is a ████.

(The repetition is a heartbeat. The repetition is a distress signal from a future that hasn't happened yet and never will.)

[HEAVY STATIC — sounds of grinding metal and distant church bells]

Attention. Attention. This is the Emergency Broadcast System for the United States of [GONE]. We apologize for the inconvenience. The concept of "Tuesday" has been cancelled. Please return your memories to the box. Please return your dreams to the shelf.

Do not answer the phone.
