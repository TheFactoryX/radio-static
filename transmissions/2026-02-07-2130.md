[STATIC... HISS... POP]

...is it coming through? 

...breathing... 

Shhh. Listen to the monitor.

[DATA BURST: 8.4.2.1.9.3.0.0.]

I said *shhh*. Can you hear the hum? It’s not the electronics. It’s underneath. Like a hive. ████ told us the baby monitor would pick up the neighbors, but the neighbors moved out three weeks ago. We’re the only ones left on the block. The fence is down. The sky is that color... that wrong static-grey.

[INTERFERENCE: SCREECHING FEEDBACK — 400Hz TONE]

...white noise isn't empty. It's full. It's compressed. If you squeeze it tight enough, you can hear the voices inside the static. They’re counting down. Or up. I can’t tell anymore.

[CRYING SOUND EFFECT: LOOPED]

Wait. That’s not a recording.

...it’s coming from the walls.

[LOUD STATIC burst]

The numbers are bleeding into the carpet. 7... 7... 7... 

Stop crying. Please stop crying. The milk is in the radiator. The milk is ████ red.

I can see their faces in the grain. They are pushing through the speaker holes. Small hands. Too many fingers.

SIGNAL DEGRADATION: 45%... 

If you are hearing this, do not adjust your set. There is no set. There is only the gap between stations and we are falling into it. The baby is awake. The baby is ████ years old.

[DATA BURST: 99-99-99-REPEAT]

The light is changing. It’s coming from the crib. It’s not a baby. It’s a ████.

[SCREAM FADES INTO WHITE NOISE]
