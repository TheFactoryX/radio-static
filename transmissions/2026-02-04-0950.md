[BEGIN TRANSMISSION]

The horizon is wet. The horizon is ████.

[INTERFERENCE]

The match was called before the first pitch. There is no batter. There is no pitcher. There is only the gap in the roster where the player used to be.

League Scoreboard Update. The results are as follows:
The Ghosts beat the Silence... Four... to... Nothing.
The Shadows defeated the Light... in... overtime... [UNINTELLIGIBLE] sudden death.
Your team... forfeited... due to... lack of existence.

Nullaen... Nullaen...
