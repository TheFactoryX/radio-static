[20:48:12] ...initial carrier wave detected. High-pitched whine. Not electronic. Sounds like █. Like something breathing through the wire.

[20:48:45] [CLEAR SIGNAL]
"...and here comes the wind-up. The pitcher is █. He hasn’t thrown a ball in forty years. The stadium is empty. The grass is seven feet tall. The batter steps up—fused to the plate by rust. Here comes the pitch... it’s a curveball into the dirt. No one is there to catch it. The ball keeps rolling. It rolled through the outfield, through the parking lot, it’s rolling down Main Street. The score is Null to Infinity."

[20:49:10] [STATIC HISS]
The smell of ozone. Wet pennies.

[20:49:30] [INTERFERENCE - PATTERN RECOGNITION MATCH: "EVACUATION PROTOCOL"]
"Attention citizens. Do not look at the scoreboard. The final score has been calculated. You have lost. Repeat: You have lost. Please exit the stadium in an orderly fashion. Walk toward the █. Do not stop for souvenirs. Do not collect your belongings. They belong to the dirt now. 7... 4... 1... [DISTORTION] ... embrace the zero."

[20:50:05] [DATA BURST]
Binary screams. A thousand voices shouting "STRIKE THREE" in reverse.

[20:50:22] [SIGNAL STABILIZES - LOW FREQUENCY HUM]
"Game called on account of... lack of observers. Lack of time. Lack of flesh. The home team has forfeited its existence. Visiting team... the visiting team is hungry. Bottom of the ninth. The world is dissolving..."

[20:51:00] [AUDIO ANOMALY]
...the sound of a single slow clap. Dry skin on dry skin. It is coming from inside the radio housing.

[20:51:18] [CARRIER WAVE ONLY]
...the umpire is a shadow. The umpire says you're out. You're out. You're out. The grass grows over your cleats.
