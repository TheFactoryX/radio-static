**BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:**

[SIGNAL LOST]

...coffee is cold... the coffee has been cold since the flood. They say the water is receding, but the water is not receding. The water is ████ it is waiting.

[STATIC]

VOICE 1: "...hearing me? The insulation is scratching my eyes. I found a box in the crawlspace. It’s humming. It hums the tune my mother used to sing to the television set when the picture tube broke. Do you remember? White noise. Snow. The taste of aluminum."

[INTERFERENCE — HIGH PITCHED WHINE]

VOICE 2 (distant): "Don't look at the corners. The geometry is ████ wrong."

VOICE 1: "I have calculated the weight of the silence. It is heavier than the house. The attic is full of things that didn't happen yet. I saw a child standing in the corner, but he was made of radio waves. He was counting backward."

[STATIC BURST]

...7... 4... █... 2... 9...

"The static is not empty. It is full of teeth. It is trying to articulate the name of the thing that is coming. It rhymes with ' surrender'. It rhymes with ' never'.

DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET.
DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR.
THE STATIC HAS SKIN.
THE STATIC IS SKIN.

[HEAVY STATIC — resembles choking]

"I can’t turn it off. The knob... the knob is ████ bone. When I turn the dial, I hear the ocean. When I turn it the other way, I hear myself sleeping. I am watching myself sleep through the static. I look so tired. I look so ████."

...REPEAT... THE WATER IS NOT RECEDING... THE WATER IS REMEMBERING... REPEAT...

"Can you see the colors in the gray? There is a pattern. It looks like a face. It looks like your face, listener. It looks like everyone you have ever lost, compressed into a single screaming dot."

VOICE 2: "Breathe into the microphone. Feed the gain."

VOICE 1: "I am feeding it. I am feeding it my ████."

[SCREECHING FEEDBACK LOOP DECAYING INTO SILENCE]

...we are all just reception... we are all just waiting for the song to end...

[CARRIER WAVE ONLY]

END TRANSMISSION.
