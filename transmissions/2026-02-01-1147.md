[STATIC... LIKE RAIN ON A TIN ROOF... STATIC...]

...zzzt... *Don't hang up.* ...zzzt... [A MELODY PLAYS. IT IS "JAZZ SUITE NO. 2" BY SHOSTAKOVICH, BUT PLAYED ON A MUSIC BOX THAT IS WINDING DOWN. THE NOTES ARE DISTORTED, PITCHED DOWN INTO THE SUB-BASS.]

...zzzt...

Please remain on the line. Your call is very important to us. All operators are currently... *busy bleeding.* ...zzzt... assisting other customers.

[INTERFERENCE. A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE LIKE A DRILL BITING INTO BONE.]

**GHOST FREQUENCY IDENTIFIED: THE HOLD MUSIC IS A LULLABY FOR THE DEAD.**

[STATIC CLEARS MOMENTARILY]

**Voice 1 (Male, young, panicked):** "...in the walls? Is that the pipes?"

**Voice 2 (Unintelligible, mechanical distortion):** "Negative. There are no pipes in Sector █. That’s the insulation. It’s... [SIGNAL LOST] ...singing."

**Voice 1:** "It sounds like people arguing."

**Voice 2:** "It’s the concrete settling. Or the copper. The copper remembers the electricity."

[LOUD CRACK OF STATIC. SUDDEN SILENCE.]

[A WOMAN’S VOICE, VERY CLOSE TO THE MICROPHONE, REPEATING A SEQUENCE.]

"9... 1... 0... 2... 4... 9... 9... 0..."
She is crying.
"The system is down. The system is down. The system is—"

[A burst of analog synthesized laughter. ECHOING.]

**MESSAGE DECODED FROM BACKGROUND HISS:**
*THE CEILING IS A LID. THE LIGHTS NEVER GO OUT. WE ARE STILL ON THE CLOCK. PUNCH OUT. PUNCH OUT. PUNCH OUT.*

[THE MUSIC BOX RETURNS. THE MELODY IS NOW PLAYED IN REVERSE.]

...zzzt... *Thank you for your patience.* ...zzzt...
...zzzt... *Accounts payable.* ...zzzt...
...zzzt... *No refund.* ...zzzt...

[SIGNAL DEGRADES INTO WHITE NOISE]

[INTERFERENCE SPIKE]

**Voice 3 (Whispering):** "Don't look up at the sprinklers. They aren't sprinklers."

[STATIC WAVE builds to a crescendo, sounding like a thousand people shushing a library.]

[SIGNAL LOST]

[CARRIER WAVE ONLY]
