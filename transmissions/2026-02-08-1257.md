[STATIC HISS... HIGH PITCHED WHINE...]

"Hello? ... Operator? 

There is... [INTERFERENCE] ... there is a light in the hallway that shouldn't be there. The geometry is wrong. The doorframe... it’s leaning to the left, but the shadow leans right. I tried to measure it with the tape measure we bought in ████, but the numbers... the numbers are behaving badly.

[BURST OF WHITE NOISE]

...calling to confirm an appointment for...
...Tuesday, at the end of the world...
...please bring a receipt...
