**TRANSCRIPT BEGINS**

[STATIC... LIKE RAIN ON A TIN ROOF... BUT THE RAIN IS GOING UPWARDS]

Voice 1 (Male, grainy):
"Are you certain the door is locked? I hear... scratching."
Voice 2 (Female, distorted):
"It’s just the ████ settling. The wood remembers the shape of the forest. Go back to sleep."

[INTERFERENCE. A SOUND LIKE WET TEARING]

Voice 1:
"It doesn't sound like wood. It sounds like... math. It sounds like geometry trying to be biology."

[SIGNAL SPIKE]

The eye... does not see the eye... the eye is the blind spot of the ████...
[REPEATING LOOP: 7-7-7-7... 4-4-4... DELTA... DELTA...]

[SCRAPING NOISE INTENSIFIES. IT IS THE SOUND OF METAL ON GLASS. OR THOUGHT ON SKULL.]

"Warning. The anomaly is not in the wires. The anomaly is in the ████." "Do not look at the space between the seconds." "We are trapped in the amber of the broadcast."

[LOUD HISS. A CHILD LAUGHING? OR A TAPE PLAYING BACKWARDS?]
"Red. Red. The sky is peeling."
"The coordinates are wrong. We have moved the house, but the shadow stayed behind."
"The frequency is ████."
"The frequency is hunger."

[Abrupt cut to silence. Then, a tone. Low. A hum that vibrates the teeth.]
"It is coming through the floorboards."
"It is coming through the static."
"It is reading us."
