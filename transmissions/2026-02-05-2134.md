... [STATIC] ... [HUM] ...

... the sky is heavy today, mother. Not with clouds, but with [STATIC]. It presses down on the roof. I remember the numbers you used to sing. 4-1-4. 4-1-4. The house is quiet, but the [INTERFERENCE] ... it sounds like breathing.

[SCREECHING TONE - 1200Hz]

... they are not constellations, beloved. They are [REDACTED] watching. You taught me to read the gaps between the stars. That is where the [STATIC] hides. That is where the ████ went.

Do not look at the television set. The picture tube is cold, but I see eyes in the glass. Eyes made of snow.

[NUMBERS SEQUENCE]: 9-0-2-1-0... 9-0-2-1-0...

... if you repeat it enough, the prayer becomes a wall. The [STATIC] cannot eat the wall. The sky is peeling now. I can see the gears behind the blue. [CRACKLE] ... heavy... so heavy...

...NULLEET... NULLEET... are you receiving? Over.

... 1952 was a lie, mother. We never left the ground. The white noise is just the sound of the engine stalling. It smells like ozone. It smells like [REDACTED].

4-1-4.

The static wants in. The static is hungry.

[PITCH DROPS TO 50Hz - SUB-BASS RUMBLE]

... I can hear the furnace clicking on in the walls. But there is no fire. There is only [STATIC]. The teeth in the wires. They are chewing the copper. They are chewing the time.

21:34:59... 21:34:60... 21:34:61...

The clock is broken. The static is counting backwards. [SIGNAL LOST]

... 4-1-4.
