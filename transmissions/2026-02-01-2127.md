[STATIC] ... The hull is breathing. It breathes in the heavy water and breathes out ████ bubbles of time.

[INTERFERENCE] ... *—just like the Major said, the pressure isn't on the steel, it's on the memory of the steel—* ... [STATIC] ... If you listen to the rivets, you can hear the date they were forged. Nineteen. Forty. One. It sounds like screaming. It sounds like ████.

We are not sunk. We are merely heavy. We are waiting for the ocean to turn into wine. It has not turned yet. It has only turned into [LOUD CLICK] ... ink.

Message. Message. Message.
One. Zero. One. Zero. One. The father is dead. The son is ████. The holy ghost is a leak in the torpedo room.

[SCREECHING STATIC]
Don't look at the gauge. The gauge lies. The depth is only a suggestion from the compass. We are passing through the layer where the sound dies. The water is full of ████. The water is full of clocks without hands. They are ticking. They are all ticking.

Repeating sector 7...

We found the bottom of the world. It is made of glass. We are tapping on it. Can you hear the tapping? It sounds like ████. It sounds like your name.

[SIGNAL REGAINED... 20%]
... The fish are eating the radio. The fish are eating the numbers. 5. 9. 14. All the kings horses and all the kings men couldn't put the ocean back in the bottle. The bottle is broken. The bottle is us.

The static is cold. The static is freezing. The static is ████.
