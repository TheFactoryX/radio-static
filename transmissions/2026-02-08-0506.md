**[BEGIN TRANSMISSION]**

...a heavy thrumming of tape hiss...
...the crackle of a vinyl record that never stops spinning...

**[MUSIC DETECTED]**
(An instrumental arrangement of "Nearer, My God, to Thee" played on a synthesizer with a dying battery. The tempo is inconsistent. It wavers between 45 and 33 RPM.)

...oooooo [STATIC] ...ssshhhhh...

The hold music is interrupted. A voice cuts through. It sounds wet. It sounds like a mouth that is learning how to speak words it has never heard.

"Welcome to the help desk. We are currently experiencing... we are currently... experiencing a high volume of... of ████."

The sound of chewing. Heavy. Wet.

"Do not worry about the paperwork. The paperwork has been devoured. The ink is running down the walls. If you are hearing this, you are not on the list. You were never on the list. The ink... it tastes like iron. It tastes like... [INTERFERENCE] ...numbers."

**[NUMBERS SEQUENCE]**
8-4-0-0
8-4-0-0
8-4-0-0
(repeated rapidly, overlapping with itself)

"Do not adjust your set. There is nothing to adjust. The adjustment is inside. The adjustment is... happening now."

A high-pitched whine builds. It sounds like the feedback loop of a microphone placed too close to a speaker that is screaming.

"The crash was not an accident. The crash was a delivery. We signed for it. We signed in ████. The weather is... the weather is... balloons. The sky is full of balloons. Do not look at the balloons. Look at the gaps between the balloons."

**[SIGNAL SPIKE]**
(The music returns, but now it is playing backwards. The synthesizer notes are elongating into a drone.)

"Instrumentality is failing. The hide is stretched too tight over the frame. We can see the bone. The bone is... glowing. Please hold. Please hold... your breath. If you breathe, you inhale the spores. The spores are memories. The spores are... 1947... never happened... 1947... is happening... now."

A series of sharp clicks. Like a Geiger counter counting down to zero.

"Puppet show. Puppet show for the... [STATIC] ...children in the... [STATIC] ...desert. Cut the strings. Cut the ████ strings."

The voice changes. It becomes a recorded automated operator, but the cadence is wrong.

"Your call is very important to us. Very... important... to... us. Please stay on the line. The entity will be with you in a moment. The entity is currently busy... eating... the... future."

**[DATA BURST]**
(A rapid stream of binary that, when decoded, forms an image of a closed eye)

Silence.

Then, a whisper. Right against the microphone diaphragm.
"The static is not noise. The static is the sound of the universe... being... deleted."

**[CARRIER WAVE ONLY]**
