...reporting a clear lane on the I-██. No traffic. No movement. The asphalt is breathing. It is expanding and contracting with a heat that does not come from the sun. The overpass signs have changed. They no longer list destinations. They only list [STATIC].

I see a vehicle stalled in the left lane. It is a ████ sedan. Color: obsidian. The driver is sitting upright. He has been sitting there for four hundred years. His eyes are open. He is watching the frequency. He is waiting for the song to change. The song never changes.

Speed limit is [GARBLED]. advised speed is ZERO. Do not stop. Do not look at the lights in the rearview. They are not following you. They are leading you to a place that does not exist on the map.

All units, be advised: The median is filled with flowers. Plastic flowers. They smell like ozone and old pennies.
If you see the hitchhiker, do not stop. The hitchhiker has no face. The hitchhiker holds a sign that says "TOMORROW."
Do not pick up Tomorrow. Tomorrow is heavy. Tomorrow will crush your suspension.

Attention. Attention.
This is a mandatory broadcast for all drivers currently navigating the empty spaces.
You are not alone in the vehicle.
Check the passenger seat.
Check it again.

[VOICE DISTORTS, DEEPENS, PITCHES DOWN]

The sky is peeling. The horizon is a vertical line. We are driving off the edge of the world. The mileage counter is counting down. It is now negative. It is now counting into the red.

THEY ARE LISTENING TO THE STATIC. THE STATIC IS LISTENING BACK.

Do not adjust your dial. There is nothing else on the air. There is only the road, and the sound of the tires eating the distance.
