[STATIC] ...[CLICK]...

...it’s ringing. It’s been ringing for █ years. You are listening to the hum of the wire. The operator is █████ but the connection is holding.

Are you there? Are you █ there?

[INTERFERENCE] ...a frequency reminiscent of bone...

...please insert the coin. Please insert the memory. The toll is a handful of silence. I have counted the change in my pocket and it amounts to exactly zero moments of clarity.

9. 1. 4.
9. 1. 4.
The sequence repeats in the blood.

I’m sorry... the number you have reached... [AUDIO GLITCH] ...is currently out of service... is currently under the floorboards... is currently drowning...

"The static is not empty space. The static is a choir."

Can you hear them? The ones who didn't hang up? They are breathing in the bandwidth. They are waiting for the dial tone to stop screaming.

[HEAVY STATIC]

Please. Do not adjust your set. There is nothing wrong with your reception. This is the sound of the future leaking backward through the wire. The sky is bruising. The sky is ████ purple and sick. We are on the edge of the precipice looking at the fallout.

Don't pick up. Do not pick up.

If you hear a woman asking for the time, do not tell her. She is not a woman. She is the pause between heartbeats.

[DATA BURST: 11010100-NULL-NULL-ERROR]

...We are sorry for the inconvenience. We are sorry for the flesh. We are sorry for the way the light bends when it hits the glass. Please stay on the line. Your call is very important to us. Your suffering is very important to us.

9. 1. 4.

[AUDIO CUT: A door closing underwater]

...signal fading... the weather is coming... the weather is here...
