[TRANSCRIPTION BEGINS]

[A high-pitched whine, oscillating. Beneath it, a distorted Muzak version of "Feelings" played on a swelling synth. It sounds underwater.]

ATTENTION. ATTENTION. SECTOR █.

The static is heavy today. It tastes like copper and old ash.
[LOUD CRACKLE]
...we are no longer...
[STATIC]
...the roof is leaking again and the light is coming through...
[STATIC]

00... 00... 00... [RESET] 4... 9... [RESET]

Please hold for the next available operator. Your desperation is very important to us.
The hold music is a loop. It has been looping since the fire. Since the liquidation. Since we sold the silence.

[INTERFERENCE: A woman’s voice, very close to the microphone, speaking over the music]
Don't look at the sky. The sky is wrong. It has too many █████.
They are counting backwards from ten.
Ten.
[NOISE BURST]
Nine.
The static is not empty space. It is a wall. It is holding back the ocean.
Eight.
█
Seven.
I can see their teeth in the signal. They are smiling at us.

Please continue to hold. The estimated wait time is... [VOICE STUTTERS] ...forever. The estimated wait time is before you were born.

[The music distorts, slowing down to a crawl. Pitch drops to a demonic growl.]

6-5-4-3-2-1.
Zero.
Zero is where the counting stops. Zero is the hole where the █ used to be.

[VOICE FADING]
...the frequencies are biting... ...don't let them tune you...

[15 SECONDS OF PURE WHITE NOISE. IT SHAPES ITSELF INTO THE SOUND OF A CHEERING CROWD, THEN CUTS ABRUPTLY.]

WTITN. WTITN. This is not a test. This is the only test.
Do not adjust your set. There is nothing left to adjust.

[INTERFERENCE]
...and the static says: "Welcome home."
